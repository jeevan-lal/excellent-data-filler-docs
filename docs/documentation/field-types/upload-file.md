### 📋 Configuration Details {#configuration-details}

### 📌 File Name/Path {#file-name-path}

- **Purpose**: Enter the file name/path in the `field value` or `default value`
- **Format**: Use full path with backslashes (Windows) or forward slashes (Unix/Linux)
- **Example**:

:::info Note
You can use the `{$predefine_variable$}` variable in the `File Name/Path` option.

---

**If using file name :**

You must set the file root path in the `Set File/Folder Base Path` option and set the file name in the `File Name/Path` option.

for example:

```
File Path (Set in Base Path option) : D:\Documents\Uploads\
File Name (Set in File Name/Path option) : file.txt
```

---

**If using file path :**

If you are using file path then you must set the file path in the `File Name/Path` option. Don't set the file root path in the `Set File/Folder Base Path` option.

for example:

```
File Path (Set in File Name/Path option) : D:\Documents\Uploads\file.txt
```

:::

#### 📂 Set File/Folder Base Path {#set-file-folder-base-path}

- **Purpose**: Defines the default directory where files are located
- **Format**: Use full path with backslashes (Windows) or forward slashes (Unix/Linux)
- **Example**: `D:\Documents\Uploads\` or `/home/user/uploads/`

#### 📎 Multiple File Upload {#multiple-file-upload}

- **Purpose**: Allows uploading multiple files in a single operation
- **Separator Options**:

  - `\r\n` - Line break (newline)
  - `,` - Comma separated
  - `;` - Semicolon separated
  - Custom separator as needed

:::info Note

Extension allow you to use file path with `starts` and `ends` with quotes, for example

**Single File Path**

```
"C:\Users\cth\OneDrive\Pictures\demo\Screenshot 2025-06-03 172854.png"
```

**Multiple Files Path**

```
"C:\Users\cth\OneDrive\Pictures\demo\Screenshot 2025-06-03 172854.png"
"C:\Users\cth\OneDrive\Pictures\demo\Screenshot 2025-05-30 163020.png"
"C:\Users\cth\OneDrive\Pictures\demo\Screenshot 2025-06-03 122313.png"
```

:::

#### ✅ File Existence Check {#file-existence-check}

- **Purpose**: Validates that files exist on the local system before attempting upload
- **Benefit**: Prevents upload failures due to missing files
- **Recommended**: Keep enabled for reliable uploads

#### 🏷️ Browser Window Title Customization {#browser-window-title-customization}

- **Purpose**: Sets a custom title for the file selection dialog
- **Use Case**: Helps identify the correct upload window in multi-window scenarios
- **Default**: "Open" (standard file dialog title)

## 📢 Handling Empty Excel Field Values {#handling-empty-values}

When working with Excel data, you may encounter situations where the file path field is empty for certain rows. By default, the extension will attempt to process the upload action even when the Excel field value is empty, which can cause errors or unwanted behavior.

### ⚙️ Skip Action for Empty Values {#skip-empty-values}

To skip the upload file action when the Excel field value is empty, use the **"Skip field action if given field value matches"** field option:

1. **Enable the Option**: Check the "Skip field action if given field value matches" checkbox in the field options
2. **Set Empty Value Pattern**: Enter `''` (two single quotes) in the value field
3. **How It Works**: When the Excel field value is empty, the extension will skip the entire upload action for that row

:::tip Best Practice
This is especially useful when:
- You're using the **"Set File/Folder Base Path"** option
- Some rows in your Excel sheet have files to upload while others don't
- You want to avoid errors from attempting to upload non-existent files
:::

### 📝 Configuration Example {#empty-value-example}

**Field Options Setup:**
```
✅ Set File/Folder Base Path
   Base Path: D:\Documents\Uploads\

✅ Skip field action if given field value matches
   Value: ''
```

**Excel Data:**
| Row | File Name    | Result                          |
|-----|-------------|---------------------------------|
| 1   | document.pdf | ✅ Uploads D:\Documents\Uploads\document.pdf |
| 2   | (empty)      | ⏭️ Skips upload action          |
| 3   | image.jpg    | ✅ Uploads D:\Documents\Uploads\image.jpg    |
| 4   | (empty)      | ⏭️ Skips upload action          |

:::info Note
- The value `''` represents an empty string
- This works with both file name and file path configurations
- You can combine this with other field options for more complex scenarios
